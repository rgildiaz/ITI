# ITI Project Documentation

Starting in the summer of 2022, I have held a position at the [Information Trust Institute](https://iti.illinois.edu/) as a program management and operations support intern. This repository compiles all the documentation I've written at the ITI so far.

Each of the files or directories in the `projects` directory are self-contained. The projects I have documented so far, in order of work, are:

- [PXE Boot ShredOS](./projects/pxeboot/README.md) - _June/July 2022_
- [Factory Reset Networking Equipment](./projects/factory-reset/README.md)  - _July 2022_
