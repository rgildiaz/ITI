# ITI Project Documentation

From summer 2022 through spring 2023, I have had the chance to work at the [Information Trust Institute](https://iti.illinois.edu/) as a program management and operations support intern. This repository compiles the documentation for all the projects I've worked on so far at the ITI.

Each of the directories in the `projects` folder are self-contained. The projects I have documented so far, in order of work, are:

- [PXE Boot ShredOS](./projects/pxeboot) - _June/July 2022_
- [Factory Reset Networking Equipment](./projects/factory-reset)  - _July 2022_
- [Testing 10G SFP+ Bidirectional Transceivers](./projects/bidi-test) - _August 2022_
- [Configure and Clone Raspberry Pi](./projects/rpi-setup/rpi-setup.md) - _September 2022_
- [Verify Installations Remotely with Ansible](./projects/ansible) - _October 2022_
- [Gravwell for Data Storage and Analysis](./projects/gravwell) - _December 2022_
- [The Grafana Observability Stack](./projects/grafana) - _January 2022_
- [Sync GitLab Groups with Active Directory](./projects/gitlab-sync) - _February-April 2022_
