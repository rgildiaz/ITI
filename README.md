# ITI Project Documentation

Starting in the summer of 2022, I have held a position at the [Information Trust Institute](https://iti.illinois.edu/) as a program management and operations support intern. This repository compiles all the documentation I've written at the ITI so far.

Each of the files or directories in the `projects` directory are self-contained. The projects I have documented so far, in order of completion, are:

- [PXE Boot ShredOS](projects/pxebootShredOS.md) - _June/July 2022_
- [Factory Reset Networking Equipment](projects/factory-reset.md) [Incomplete] - _July 2022_
- [Testing 10G SFP+ Bidirectional Transceivers](projects/bidi-test.md) - _August 2022_
- [Configure and Clone Raspberry Pi](projects/rpi-setup/rpi-setup.md) [Incomplete] - _September 2022_
- [Verify Installations Remotely with Ansible](projects/le-rpi-ansible/verify-w-ansible.md) - _October 2022_
- [Gravwell for Data Storage and Analysis](projects/gravwell/README.md) [Incomplete] - _December 2022_

Have a look around and let me know if you spot any typos or errors!

Also, note that I've included the names of some of my managers here. If you see "David" or "Matthew" anywhere in the documents, they are the full-time staff members I'm working with!
