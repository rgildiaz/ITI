# ITI Project Documentation

Over the summer and fall of 2022, I have held an internship at the [Information Trust Institute](https://iti.illinois.edu/), helping with program management and operations support. This repository compiles all the documentation I've written at the ITI so far.

Each of the files or directories in the ``projects`` directory are self-contained. The projects I have documented so far, in order of completion, are:

- [PXE Boot ShredOS](projects/pxebootShredOS.md) - _July 2022_
- [Factory Reset Networking Equipment](projects/factory-reset.md) [Incomplete] - _July 2022_
- [Testing 10G SFP+ Bidirectional Transceivers](projects/bidi-test.md) - _August 2022_
- [Configure and Clone Raspberry Pi](projects/rpi-setup/rpi-setup.md) - _September 2022_

Have a look around and let me know if you spot any typos or errors!
