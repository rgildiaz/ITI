## The Observability Stack
While Grafana Labs' various products can be used separately from each other, I used [Grafana](#grafana), [Loki](#loki), and [Promtail](#promtail) all together for this project.

### Grafana
Grafana Labs' namesake product is _Grafana_, a visualization and dashboarding software that can be run [from the cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/introduction/grafana-cloud/) or [hosted locally](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/introduction/) (with an option to upgrade to an [Enterprise scale](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/introduction/grafana-enterprise/)). It has rich [integrations for many industry standard data sources](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/), including [InfluxDB](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/influxdb/), [MySQL](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/mysql/), and [PostgreSQL](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/postgres/).
