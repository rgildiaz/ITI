## Gravwell Components
When taking a look at [Gravwell's system architecture](https://docs.gravwell.io/architecture/architecture.html), you might find the following pieces:
- **Backend**: [Ingest](#ingest),  [Storage](#storage)
- **Frontend**: [Analysis](#analysis), [Search](#search), [Automation](#automation)

### [Ingest](https://docs.gravwell.io/ingesters/ingesters.html)
Gravwell's ingesters "gather incoming data, package it into Gravwell entries, and ship it to Gravwell indexers for storage." Gravwell offers many different [official ingesters](https://docs.gravwell.io/ingesters/ingesters.html#ingesters-list), and the [open-source ingest API](https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell/tree/master/ingest) allows for the creation of your own ingesters.

#### [Tags](https://docs.gravwell.io/ingesters/ingesters.html#tags)
Every piece of data that Gravwell ingests is tagged. Tags allow for easier [search](#search) and [query](#analysis), and categorize incoming data.

### [Storage]()
Storage in Gravwell is handled by indexers,

## Gravwell Features & Constraints
### Data Ingest
The free community edition of Gravwell has an ingest limit of 13.9 GB/day. While this should usually be enough for small systems, I ran into issues while trying to migrate existing data. Since I was given 30 GB of data total, it was impossible to ingest it all in one day.

## Personal Opinions
### Mediocre Documentation
While the Gravwell documentation is useable, it seems less extensive or polished than the documentation for comparable services, like Splunk. Specifically, it seems to lack a very comprehensive introduction. While a [training manual](./gravwell_training_5.1.2.pdf) is offered, it only contains information relevant to certification and (in my opinion) lacks sufficient instruction for "getting started".

There is also less of a public user-base on forums such as Stack Overflow, making finding answers for specific issues sometimes a little difficult when compared to other, more widely-used platforms.

### "Ingest Anything"
On their [Gravwell vs Splunk page](https://www.gravwell.io/gravwell-vs-splunk), the makers of Gravwell tout that "[their] platform ingests everything and compromises nothing. Splunk canâ€™t say that." However, it seems like Splunk can also ingest anything.

In the [Splunk Enterprise Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.2/Data/WhatSplunkcanmonitor), 


## Alternative Software
### [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com)
Gravwell positions its product in [direct competition with Splunk](https://www.gravwell.io/gravwell-vs-splunk). Some main differences are:
- **Pricing Model** - Gravwell offers node-based pricing, while [Splunk offers volume- or compute-based pricing](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/pricing/enterprise-platform.html).
- **Search/Query** - Splunk uses a proprietary query language. Gravwell's query language is open source. 

### [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
In my opinion, Grafana handles data visualization and analysis more elegantly than Gravwell. Grafana also offers solutions for [logging](https://grafana.com/logs/), [metrics](https://grafana.com/metrics/), and [tracing](https://grafana.com/traces/).
