## Gravwell Features & Constraints
### Ingest Anything
While other services like [Splunk](#splunk) can only ingest 

The free community edition of Gravwell has an ingest limit of 13.9 GB/day. While this should usually be enough for small systems, I ran into issues while trying to migrate existing data. Since I was given 30 GB of data total, it was impossible to ingest it all in one day.

## Personal Opinions
### Weak Documentation
While the Gravwell documentation is serviceable, it seems less extensive or polished than the documentation for comparable services, like Splunk.

### "Ingest Anything"
On their [Gravwell vs Splunk page](https://www.gravwell.io/gravwell-vs-splunk), the makers of Gravwell tout that "[their] platform ingests everything and compromises nothing. Splunk canâ€™t say that." However, it seems like Splunk can also ingest anything.

In the [Splunk Enterprise Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.2/Data/WhatSplunkcanmonitor), 


## Alternative Software
### Splunk
Gravwell positions its product in [direct competition with Splunk](https://www.gravwell.io/gravwell-vs-splunk). Some main differences are:
- **Pricing Model** - Gravwell offers node-based pricing, while [Splunk offers volume- or compute-based pricing](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/pricing/enterprise-platform.html).
- **Data Ingest** -
